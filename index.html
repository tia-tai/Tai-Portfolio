          <p>
            Tai is a junior at Science Leadership Academy with a knack for
            programming various projects, from web development to image
            manipulation. With 5 years of experience in programming and
            STEM-based fields, he thrives in the face of technical challenges.
            Outside of programming, he is a rice and bread connoisseur.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Another known fact about him is that he has been in robotics for
            three years and has designed and programmed countless intake
            mechanisms. He loves creating complex designs that do what they are
            meant to do. Some might say he is overengineering, but
            overengineering should be the minimum. Other than robotics, Tai has
            been involved in various engineering and AI internships and
            competitions, working to refine his command over Python, AI, CAD,
            and problem-solving skills.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            After college, Tai aims to work as a mechatronic engineer,
            developing robots and devices that will help solve daily dilemmas
            and make the world a better place. Although if the world takes a
            different turn, he is always up for working at Lockheed Martin.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Lately, he can be found at home binge-watching YouTube shorts or
            running around Pennypack.

              <h3>DoseMate</h3>
              <p>
                DoseMate is my team's (Analeigh, Rafi, Ryan, and I) Arduino
                invention for the SLA 2025 junior Arduino invention challenge.
                DoseMate is an automatic pill dispenser that holds up to six
                different pills and portions them for you. While Analeigh and
                Rafi worked on the CAD and structure aspect of the dispenser,
                Ryan and I worked on the electronic side. Ryan spent most of the
                time tuning the servos, while I mainly worked on the user
                interface and backend. I developed a user interface using a
                button, LCD screen, and a rotary encoder. All of this is
                connected to an array that stores all the information and
                processes it.
              </p>
              <p>
                The biggest struggle during this project was getting the Arduino
                to communicate to the ESP 32 and for the servos to turn to
                exactly where they had to go. The problem with communication was
                solved after two days of programming, however, the servos were
                never able to be fully calibrated due to the lack of an encoder.
              </p>
              <p>
                Ultimately, DoseMate never worked as intended, but I learned a
                lot about programming in C and working with Arduinos and ESP.

              <h3>Wanderer</h3>
              <p>
                Wanderer is the app that we created. It is an AI smart
                exploration app that helps the youth, especially students,
                become more socially aware and truly understand the important
                cultural and historical aspects of their community through
                interactive in-person and virtual guided tours. The purpose of
                our app is to also combat the decrease in social interaction
                because of high screen time usage by encouraging the youth to
                utilize technology for a good purpose and explore what their
                area has to offer. The goal is to make learning interactive,
                fun, and immersive by connecting people with the places around
                them.
              </p>
              <p>
                Throughout the project, I helped to research and played a
                significant role in designing the application on Figma by
                applying UI/UX rules.
              </p>
              <p>
                After several months, my team and I pitched our app to a panel
                of judges and placed 2nd out of 8 teams.

                Law by AI is an accessible and engaging technology for people of
                all ages and backgrounds to exercise their knowledge of law
                every day.
              </p>
              <p>There are two versions of Law By AI:</p>
              <p>
                The daily challenge is similar to the popular game, "Wordle."
                Users have five replies to solve a legal scenario. This game
                mode is ranked and displayed on the leaderboard.
              </p>
              <p>
                The freeplay version is similar to daily, however, users can
                work their way through multiple prompts and working in a way
                that's unranked.

                The final section of the SLA 2024 Sophomore Rube Goldberg
                machine. We used CAD, mechanical engineering, and electrical
                engineering to bring Wilbur Scoville's Ski Resort to life.
              </p>
              <p>
                The goal of this section was to bring the egg to the skillet.
                But we included a twist. We included a servo that seasoned the
                egg with the hottest hot sauce we could find.
              </p>
              <p>
                During the actual performance, our section failed 11 times and
                finally succeeded on the 12th.
              </p>
              <p>
                The 11 failures came from problems with the electronics
                components, like servos and beam breaks, which were difficult to
                use without prior electrical engineering knowledge.

              <h3>PaiKitty</h3>
              <p>
                PaiKitty is a Discord JRPG bot. Players collect anime characters
                and use them in battles.
              </p>
              <p>
                PaiKitty was developed using Discord.py, a Python library that
                allows me to interact with the Discord API. Having learned from
                my earlier, slower version of PaiKitty, which used JSON as the
                database, I opted for learning MongoDB, which is a non-SQL
                database. Being a non-SQL database, MongoDB is organized like
                JSON while being more efficient with more data.
              </p>
              <p>
                Ultimately, PaiKitty was discontinued in early 2024, but the
                experience of MongoDB and Python stayed.

              <h3>Meow! Search</h3>
              <p>
                Meow! Search is a search engine that I created because of the
                fear of being tracked. Modern search engines collect a ton of
                information from their users. Every search they make, so that
                they can make their query results "better." But who knows what
                is really happening with our data? Thus, Meow! Search was
                created to eliminate that fear.
              </p>
              <p>
                Meow! Search was programmed entirely in Python. I used libraries
                like Flask for the webpage, BeautifulSoup to scrape the web, and
                JSON to store the website and extra information.
              </p>
              <p>
                Throughout the process, I did a lot of research into Google and
                Bing. I discovered that Google's website ranking algorithm is
                based on backlinks. These are linked from one website that links
                back to another. So that's exactly how I created my search
                engine.
              </p>
              <p>
                The main challenge of this project was that JSON is not designed
                to function as a database, so each query took six minutes, and
                the amount of data that could be stored was limited.
                Additionally, most websites have limits for how many times you
                can access them per second, and the web scraper I programmed
                moved way too fast, so I was temporarily banned from many
                websites.
              </p>
              <p>
                Ultimately, I ran into hardware limits and had to stop the

              <h3>Photovoltaic Array Plan</h3>
              <p>
                During the course of my sophomore internship, I worked alongside
                an electrical engineer at Burns Engineering Group. We studied
                specific components of photovoltaic systems, including panels,
                combiner boxes, inverters, and wires.
              </p>
              <p>
                Finally, for the final project, I created a photovoltaic system
                for a concept school in Philadelphia. I looked into panels and
                inverters that are compatible with each other. Then, calculated
                the azimuth and angle to maximize the output. Finally, to
                account for the significant output loss of panels in partial
                shading, I included power optimizers, which are small chips
                attached to the back of PV arrays.
